# ❤️ HeartyBot: An RAG-Powered Cardiovascular Health Assistant

**HeartyBot** is an intelligent AI assistant built to assist in **cardiovascular health queries** using both **medical PDFs** and **advanced biomedical language models**. It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide **citation-backed, page-specific responses** — using **BioMistral-7B**, **PubMedBERT**, and **LangChain** over **ChromaDB**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **PDF Upload**: Upload one or multiple medical PDFs (e.g., WHO reports, clinical guidelines).
- 🤖 **Bio-Aware LLM Responses**: Uses **BioMistral-7B** fine-tuned for biomedical knowledge.
- 📚 **Citation & Page Tracking**: Answers are linked with the page numbers and document names.
- 🧠 **Domain-specific Embeddings**: Generated via **PubMedBERT** for enhanced medical accuracy.
- 🌐 **LangChain RAG Pipeline**: Structured document QA via chunking, embedding, retrieval, and generation.
- 💡 **Future Scope - ECG Analysis**: Extendable for ECG CSV data for arrhythmia classification.
- 🖥️ **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and responsive UI for users to chat with HeartyBot.

## 🖼️ Example Output

**Question**: *What are the main behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular diseases globally?*

**Answer**:  
The main behavioral risk factors mentioned for cardiovascular diseases globally are cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, physical inactivity, and diabetes. These can be prevented by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, and managing existing health conditions.

## 💡 Future Scope: ECG Classification

HeartyBot can be extended into a hybrid health assistant that:

- 🩺 Accepts ECG data files (`.csv`, `.json`)
- 🧠 Uses ML/DL to classify conditions like Atrial Fibrillation, Tachycardia, Bradycardia, etc.
- 📊 Cross-references structured signal data with unstructured knowledge (e.g., PDF guidelines)
- 🧬 Potential to evolve into a **smart diagnostic assistant**
